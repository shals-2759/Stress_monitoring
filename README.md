# Stress_monitoring
This is an AIML based stress monitoring application with personalised feedbacks and statistics.This repository consists of various frontend and backend files that I have used in the development of this project. In this project I have tried to track the real time data of the user and creating an ML model and trained it using the extracted data .
I have also built a simple chatbot for clarifying doubts of the user related to stress and tips for managing stress.
I have used various charts to visualize the stress levels to the user and also providing personalised feedbacks to the user based on the retrieval of the tracked websites and the user can also see his activities using this feature.
